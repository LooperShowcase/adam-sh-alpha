      In February 2016, BMW announced the M4 Competition Package. The M4
      Competition Package boasts 331 kW (450 PS; 444 hp)[16] and a revised
      suspension for better handling. New springs, dampers and anti-roll bars
      complement the included Adaptive M Suspension. BMW also re-tuned the
      electronic differential and the Dynamic Stability Control to match the
      upgraded hardware. The interior remains largely unchanged, but Competition
      Package cars get new lightweight sport seats along with the M-striped
      woven seat belts. The exterior includes the M Sport exhaust with black
      chrome tailpipes and high gloss Shadow Line exterior trim. Gloss black
      trim is added to the kidney grille, side gills, and model badge on the
      trunk.[17] With the Competition Package, the coupe version accelerates
      from standstill to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.0 seconds. There is a
      convertible version, and that does the run in 4.2 seconds, both coupe and
      convertible forms using the dual clutch transmission.
