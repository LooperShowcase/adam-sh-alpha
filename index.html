        Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, commonly referred to as BMW (German
        pronunciation: (About this soundlisten)), is a German multinational
        corporate manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles headquartered
        in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. The corporation was founded in 1916 as a
        manufacturer of aircraft engines, which it produced from 1917 until 1918
        and again from 1933 to 1945. Automobiles are marketed under the brands
        BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce, and motorcycles are marketed under the brand
        BMW Motorrad. In 2017, BMW was the world's fourteenth-largest producer
        of motor vehicles, with 2,279,503 vehicles produced. The company has
        significant motorsport history, especially in touring cars, Formula 1,
        sports cars and the Isle of Man TT. BMW is headquartered in Munich and
        produces motor vehicles in Germany, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, the
        Netherlands, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
        The Quandt family is a long-term shareholder of the company (with the
        remaining shares owned by public float), following brothers Herbert and
        Harald Quandt's investments in 1959 which saved the company from
        bankruptcy.
